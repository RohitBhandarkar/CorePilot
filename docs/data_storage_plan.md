# Scheduling Event Logging and Storage Strategy

## Overview

Capturing high-frequency Linux scheduler events using tools like `bpftrace` generates large volumes of data rapidly. Efficient storage and management of these logs are essential to ensure usability and scalability of your ML-driven CPU scheduler project.

## Recommended Storage Approaches

### 1. Log File Splitting

- Split large CSV files by size or number of lines to create manageable chunks.
- Example commands:
  - By size:
    ```
    split -b 100m sched_trace.csv sched_trace_
    ```
  - By lines:
    ```
    split -l 100000 sched_trace.csv sched_trace_
    ```
- Ensure each split file has the CSV header added for ease of downstream analysis.

### 2. Log Rotation

- Automate log rotation using tools like `logrotate` or custom scripts.
- Rotate logs based on file size or elapsed time.
- Retain only a set number of rotated logs to control disk usage.

### 3. Use More Efficient Formats

- Convert CSV logs into binary columnar formats such as Parquet or HDF5 for better compression and faster data processing.
- This conversion can be done post-collection during data preprocessing before feeding to ML models.

### 4. Filtering and Sampling

- Apply filters during trace collection to limit stored data to relevant processes/events.
- Employ sampling techniques (e.g., logging every Nth event) to reduce log volume when full fidelity is unnecessary.

## Practical Recommendations

- Start with log splitting for initial development and prototyping.
- Introduce log rotation for continuous data collection.
- Plan to migrate to binary formats as data volume grows.
- Use filtering and sampling to optimize storage and processing needs without losing critical insights.
