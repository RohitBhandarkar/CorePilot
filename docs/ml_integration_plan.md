# ML-Driven Scheduler Integration â€” Reference Structure

This file summarizes the options and design choices for integrating a machine learning (ML) model with the Linux process scheduler, acting both as documentation and as a decision guide for future reference.

## Purpose

To provide a structured blueprint for how an ML model trained on scheduling event data can interface with the Linux scheduling system, highlighting implementation options, required model outputs, and control pathways.

## 1. What Does the ML Model Predict?

- The **next process (or thread) to schedule** at each decision point (i.e., context switch opportunity), based on current system/process state.
- Alternatively, **priorities or scores for each candidate process**, allowing the highest to be picked.
- Inputs should include: process stats, CPU usage, latency, role/type, and system context.


## 2. Integration Approaches

| Method | Where Model Runs | How Scheduling is Modified | Complexity | Safety/Risk |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Userland Daemon/Priority Adjust | Userland | Adjusts process priorities (nice, chrt, cgroups) by periodically polling and applying model output | Low | Very Safe |
| Kernel Advisory Hook/Module | Userland+Kernel | Kernel consults hints/inputs from userland model (via syscalls, IPC, shared memory) | Moderate | Safe/Moderate |
| Full Kernel Scheduler Rewrite | Kernel | ML model inference runs in kernel, directly makes scheduling decisions | High | Advanced; risky |

## 3. Key Implementation Notes

- **Start with userland control:** Use a daemon to set process priority/affinity, allowing non-invasive validation of your model.
- **Model output:** Should match the integration path (either single PID or list of process priorities).
- **Logging and evaluation:** Always log actual Linux scheduling decisions (via `ftrace`, `perf`, or eBPF) to evaluate and benchmark model performance.
- **Move deeper if needed:** Only pursue kernel module or patch when userland approaches are proven insufficient.


## 4. Comparison: Snapshot vs. Scheduling Event Logging

| Logging Type | Data Granularity | Captures Every Schedule? | Suitable For ML? | Complexity | Storage Needs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Snapshot (interval) | Coarse (minutes) | No | Low-fidelity pipelines | Low | Low |
| Scheduling Event (trace) | Fine (ms/sub-ms) | Yes | High-fidelity ML | Moderate | High |

## 5. Practical Recommendations

- **For rapid prototyping:** Snapshots suffice for system-wide stats and project development.
- **For accurate ML-based scheduling:** Log and train on event-level scheduling decisions for evaluation and real-world improvement.
- **For incremental deployment:** Begin userland, progress deeper into kernel integration as necessary.


## 6. Example Directory Structure

```shell
/project-root/
    /artifacts/
        process_data.json       # JSON logs from userland script (snapshots)
        scheduling_events.log   # Event trace logs (from perf, ftrace, etc.)
    /ml_model/
        trainer.py              # ML training code using event logs
        inference_daemon.go     # Daemon to assign priorities
    /integration/
        kernel_module.c         # (Optional) Kernel module for deep integration
    structure.md                # This file: key design and comparison notes
    README.md
```
